# SingleCycleRV32I_Processor
This is my Implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor using RV32I ISA all in SystemVerilog including detailed architecture and example programs..
provided above are files for the design, program to test it on in both assembly and machine language, presentation for the design with explained blocks.
You'd need to use the machine language one to test the code if you want.
