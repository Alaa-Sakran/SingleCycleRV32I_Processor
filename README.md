# SingleCycleRV32I_Processor

This repository contains my implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor using the RV32I ISA, all written in SystemVerilog. The design includes a detailed architecture and example programs.

## Features

- **Architecture**: Comprehensive design of a single-cycle processor.
- **Instruction Set**: RV32I ISA including:
  - **Load/Store Instructions**: `lw`, `sw`
  - **R-Type Instructions**: Standard arithmetic and logical operations
  - **I-Type Instructions**: Immediate arithmetic and logical operations
  - **Branch Instructions**: `beq`, `blt`
  - **Jump Instructions**: `jal`, `jalr`
  - **Upper Immediate Instruction**: `lui`

## Files Included

- **Design Files**: SystemVerilog source code for the processor.
- **Test Programs**: Programs to test the design in both assembly and machine language.
- **Presentation**: A presentation explaining the design blocks.

## How to Use

To test the code, use the machine language files provided in the repository.
